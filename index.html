            You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why I am
            learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web Development Hero.

                They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They
                liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
